# ArrayTransformCpp

This simple C++ program does the following : 

    Read two 2D arrays, A and B.
    print both arrays, A and B.
    find array C which is equal to A + B if mathematically possible, and print array C.
    find the sum of elements in array A which are below the main diameter.
    find array D which is the transpose of array B
    
that is all of it. Have fun checking it out ;)
